# DeepTricorder

## Requirements
 - Windows 10: This project developed on a Windows 10 computer, so these instructions will work in that setting. Anything else will most likely require some modifications. 
 - Tensorflow 2.0+: `conda create -n tf-gpu tensorflow-gpu cudatoolkit=10.1` will care of both CUDA and TF environments. 
 - Some Python stuff: `pip install opencv-python scipy numpy matplotlib`

## Get Started
To simply try out the app: 
1. Set your Android phone to developer mode, with ADB debugging enbabled. 
2. Plug your phone into your computer. Ensure that it shows up if you run `adb devices`. 
3. Go into the personalization_module folder and double-click on 'revert.bat.' This will install the original, existing APK.

Alternatively, feel free to open it up in Android Studio and freshly build & install it from there.
